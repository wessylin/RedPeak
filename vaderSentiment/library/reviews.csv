R3MPTX8KAGSWG1,David Fisher,"This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick. In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2019",This is NOT a Budget Laptop!,5,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XURpeSD+L.jpg,4,R3 3200U,15.6-inch
R1FQ1D4LKTEGUG,Wilderness Family,"This year, both our old laptops gave up the ghost and we had to buy new ones. I first did research for my wife. She likes to move her laptop to various chairs around the house. Once online, connected to the world through WiFi, she looks up news and other things, checks her email, does banking, and watches a few videos. Sometimes we talk to family and friends on Skype. I know a lot more about computers than she does, so she asked me to find one for her. A touch-screen wasn't important, so I was looking for a thin, attractive, high-resolution screen laptop, with reasonable speed and a solid operating system. We've also tried tablets , but without a decent physical keyboard, found them lacking. The bonus was, judging by her needs, I didn't think we needed to break the bank to find a decent machine at the lower end of the scale. When we bought it, just a month ago at the time of this writing, the price was a hair under $350. Today, a quick review of the product page shows they've shoved that up by $70 to $420. Why?? I have to say, that might have been a deal-breaker.However, I did choose this Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop. It arrived and I went to work to set it up for her. It was pretty intuitive. Plug it in, press the power button, and follow the prompts. Easy. However, we like to use a lot of apps not made (or even approved) by Microsoft. The laptop comes with Windows 10 on it, in Microsoft's ""S"" mode. In other words, they set it up so you can only get Microsoft programs and apps that come from their online store. If that doesn't suit you, don't despair: you can opt out of that ""Microsoft-only"" mode during setup.For example, we like using the Opera browser, not M's ""Edge."" As soon as you try and download the program, Microsoft pop ups appear, all concerned: ""are you sure?"" ""Apps not approved by Microsoft may be dangerous -- may damage your computer."" And ""once you abandon S mode, you will not be able to get it back!"" Don't worry, go ahead and press the button. You'll still have Windows 10 and can choose apps from wherever you want them.I'm not going to go through the technical stuff in this review. You can read all about that on this product page. I'll just tell you, the laptop is attractive, light and thin, the screen is big enough for everything you want to do, including watching videos and movies, and it is in good resolution. It runs quietly, and its interface with WiFi and online webpages is good. The backlit keyboard is nicely laid out and easy to type on. You get 3 x USB ports, plus others. You get 4 gigs of working RAM, which may not sound like a lot, but it's plenty to handle watching videos etc. You get 128 gigs of memory on the harddrive -- again, not huge, but it is solid state, which means, dependable. And these days, it's so easy to add an external drive or get yourself a bunch of thumb drives which are now cheap - cheap - cheap. And of course, you can use Microsoft's One Drive (installed) or any other cloud memory service you prefer.My wife is happy with her Acer. And then, a couple of weeks after we got hers, my own laptop went down for the final count. I happen to do advanced video and photograph editing on two different desktops, a PC and a Mac for various applications. But I also like to use a laptop for much of the same things my wife does. My choice was even easier this time. I chose the same Acer we'd just acquired for her. Fortunately, I also got the $350 price, or we would have paid an extra $140 on our two purchases.In the meantime, we're enjoying our Acer laptops.

I’ve spent hours going from one solution to another and putting the computer away to keep myself from throwing it against the wall. What makes it okay to wall away all my favorite apps and leave behind nothing but junk I don’t want? I could say so much more but then they wouldn’t post it. I want a laptop and now that I have personal information on it I feel trapped into keeping it, so I probably won’t return it, but it also might end up collecting dust in the corner because I can’t get it to work right.-Update- It is now free of s mode.

R2ND3IETU6GEDB,Amazon Customer,"The Short Story: Windows S-mode is stupidly impossible to turn off and Acer should be embarrassed to have this pre-installed on their machines.The Long Story: It was time for a new laptop. I have babied my little 4yo Lenovo Flex14 for as long as possible, but when the number row on the keyboard stopped working, I realized it was time. So I started researching laptops, trying to find one that had the most features for the best price. I read plenty about S-mode and read plenty of reviews that said that it was easy to turn S-mode off. And I read plenty of angry reviews from people that tried everything to get rid of S-mode and eventually returned it to Amazon. But that wouldn't happen to me. I was sure that the angry people must not have followed directions or were technologically impaired. So after much researching and comparing, I settled on this sweet little Acer. With the exception of not having a touchscreen, it ck'd all of my other boxes.I placed my order and anxiously tracked my delivery the next day, refreshing the Amazon order page every 5min. It finally arrived and I almost dropped it, I was so excited w anticipation. I opened the pkg, noting the Windows 11 sticker w S-mode instructions. Very few things smell better than a new laptop when you open the box. I plugged it in and powered it on. The screen was lovely. The keyboard keys were flatter than my Lenovo, but easy to use. The touchpad was very responsive. I went thru all of the steps to get it setup and patiently waited for it to go thru all of it's updates and finally, the moment of truth: turning off S-mode. I carefully followed the instructions on the box. I followed the instructions on the screen. I followed the FAQ instructions on the Windows page. I googled instructions and for 36hrs, I was obsessed w finding The Fix to turn this d*maned S-mode off. I lit some sage to clean it's aura. I recited healing scriptures over it. I watched so many YouTube videos, it messed up my algorithm and now I have plenty of How to Get Rid of S-mode on my feed. I almost called in a priest for an exorcism. I felt defeated and relegated myself to the Technologically Impaired side of the room. I started the refund/return process and I was packing it up, the last thing I saw was that stupid Windows 11 S-mode instruction sticker, mocking me, and I had the sudden urge to yeat the stupid box w it's stupid laptop and it's stupid S-mode out the window.So buyer beware: if you need to do anything that Uncle Bill hasn't approved of, you.are.screwed. At the very least, I just needed Citrix and Chrome installed to do my job. SO simple and yet, Uncle Bill and Microsoft deem them unworthy to be in their Microsoft Store. However, as a consolation prize, Microsoft was thrilled to let me know, via a pop-up box that I had to continually click out of, that I was eligible to download a variety of games *including Minecraft* via the The Store!! Eeeeeek!! How exciting!! I'm certain my employer would have been delighted to find out I was able to play Minecraft on my new laptop, but not the program that I actually needed for my job. Too bad cute little cartoon blocks can't pay the bills. :(Also... a word of caution... if you don't want S-mode, read thru every laptop description *thoroughly*. I was shocked at how many laptops had only Windows 11 listed in the Title/Heading, but when I read through the description, I would find that it was actually Windows 11 w S-mode. It was always the ones w lengthy descriptions listing all of it's FABULOUS features oh... and btw (last item mentioned), it has Windows 11 in S-mode. :-\","Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2024",Windows S[tupid]-Mode,2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VIJbTN1DL.jpg,6,2023 model,15.6-inch
R20Q9YKGWVMIK3,Mackenzie,"I have had a Acer Chromebook since 2019 and have needed to upgrade for awhile. I recently got a new remote job that pretty much forced me to upgrade since the Chromebook had 2GB of RAM and almost no storage.This Acer has been great for the past month. I was looking for something with at least 8GB RAM and 256 or more memory. The speed of this computer has been wonderful. I can have multiple tabs going at once and have had no issues thus far. I have not loved Windows operating systems in the past, but this one isn't too bad. Once you get rid of Microsoft edge and use Google Chrome, it was back to business as usual for me. Perfect size for me, lightweight and easy to travel. The protective case it came with was a small, but nice bonus as well.Battery life hasn't been tested too specifically yet but I have easily worked for 3-4 hours off the charger and have had plenty of battery left. So I think it's going to be just fine in that regard.I've been told I can probably do some gaming with this computer but I haven't tried that yet, as I much rather use my PS5. All in all, this computer is plenty powerful for what I need. Zoom calls, research, multiple tabs open, Slack, ClickUp (productivity apps).Highly recommend at this price point.","Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024",Great work computer for a great price,5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713UlMDSaeL.jpg

R10NISG7PZIG7R,TalesOfArkYT,"My second ever Acer laptop. I had a small one in my younger years, and that thing struggle quite a long. This laptop is pretty much better in all it’s way, but that because of today technology. Honestly speaking, this laptop isn’t that great, but it’s good enough for what I need it for, which is good enough for me. For $300, and even less on sales. You can do some light office/college/business work, light browsing, and very very light gaming on low setting. Unless it’s an old MMO, you could probably get away with medium or higher, but don’t expect much. This thing may have “8” gb ram, but in honesty. You’re probably going to have around 3.5-4gb ram free, as window system will eat majority of it. My biggest complaint is that you can’t upgrade the ram, it’s sadly soldered on. Unlike the storage, which is upgradable, but do know you’ll have to reinstall window. The casing feels “light”, very light, enough to where to I don’t want to apply too much pressure as it might deform or bent it in a way, maybe cheap material. The display is….. uh do able? It’s very dim and the color is like off, very off, don’t expect to do any artsy stuff with correct colors. As for battery, it leaves a lot to be desire. Depending on what you’re doing you could be around 2-7hr battery life, so make sure to always keep it plugged in. The keyboard is fine, it’s nice to have a laptop with the side pad, it’s something I use for when I do light gaming. Other than, it’s a pretty all rounder budget laptop for a cheap price. Worth it for my use case, as I already have a gaming PC and a Steam Deck.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2024","Not Great, but Decent Enough",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GGi4aheBL.jpg

RI0DYRACJ8693,Johnny Tezz,"What at first sight caught my attention was the design of this laptop, minimalist to put it in some way, having it in my hands because I am not disappointed at all, the build quality is good for a laptop of this price (I acquired it for $ 309.99 dollars), the touchpad is of a considerable size because it allows you to navigate freely and the gestures, are quite intuitive, the bad thing that you notice is that you click manually (if you prefer since it is better to do it through the configuration of two fingers ) The touchpad is perceived loose, cleaning it shows as if it moved to the sides. The keyboard is magnificent, the position of the keys is just what you need, the noise it makes when you type it is not annoying, it has lighting which helps you a lot when using it in low light, it is programmed to turn off if you do not use it which is good if you are watching a movie, reading or watching videos on YouTube. The screen is very good, to be honest I was very surprised, its quality is quite clear the colors are not appreciated false or over saturated, the image quality it offers is something that will fascinate you outdoors because you have to look for a good angle of that shape will not be affected, the brightness is decent if you want to lower it to a minimum and when you choose to upload it to the maximum you will appreciate the clear images without perceiving that feeling of discomfort. In terms of performance I can not add much, of course the programs I use because I do not consider them something that requires too much resources from the processor, it is worth mentioning that I chose the laptop with an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U Dual-Core Processor 2.6GHz. I consider it a laptop for normal day-to-day use, to perform tasks in Excel, to do documents, to browse the web, are things that make them very easily the solid state disk (128 SSD) allows you to open programs with very easily, even with the basic specifications you will have a very good performance and speed, I have installed Autocad 3D which is the program that I normally have installed on my MacBook Pro and it turns out that it runs without any complications. Windows 10 version S is installed at the factory.The audio is quite good for the price of the laptop, the music is clear but do not expect to have a serious and powerful sound I will only tell you that it is good, what I disliked was the fact when I put the laptop on my legs or on the surface From my bed the audio is compromised. The battery life I would put about 5 hours with a medium intensive use.Summing up if what you are looking for is a PC that has a good performance and speed for basic day-to-day use in current standards, because this is your option, if you are looking for something more professional then you will have to look at more options that offer you higher specifications, at least I use it for personal use and I am very happy with its performance, I have not installed any games so I can not give you a review about its behavior in games.Switching out of S mode in windows 10On your PC running Windows 10 in S mode, open Settings > Update & Security > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home or Switch to Windows 10 Pro section, select Go to the Store. (If you also see an ""Upgrade your edition of Windows"" section, be careful not to click the ""Go to the Store"" link that appears there.)On the Switch out of S mode (or similar) page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button. After you see a confirmation message on the page, you'll be able to install apps from outside of the Microsoft Store.","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2019",Out of the blue .,5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716Lyx7mz6L.jpg

R9WWKNIP6KC8Z,Tator Tot,"This is going to be a long and detailed review! Prior to purchasing this laptop, I did a tremendous amount of research so I know how important reviews are, as they helped me make my final decision. In order to help reviewers, I will say up front that I am not a gamer. I am a proofreader/copy editor, spend a lot of time on computers for internet research, including youtube work, and at any given time I have about 7-10 windows open and my computer is THEE primary source/focus of my work. I've had this Acer since mid-August. I waited to write my review in order to see how it performed for a couple of months, as some of the reviews I initially read did the same and I found that to be really helpful.My 12-year-old SONY Vaio ""died"" this summer and I found myself in a position of needing a new laptop but also needing to be really budget conscious due to COVID job constraints. I read over 131 Amazon reviews of this Acer, read two other independent consumer review sites (PC Magazine, Tech World), and asked some tech people in my world what they thought. This laptop came out in the top three for quality for the price. The price was $359 when I put it in my cart. I waited ONE MORE DAY and that was ONE DAY TOO LONG and by the next day, the laptop was no longer available by Amazon, only from independent Marketplace sellers. I contacted Amazon who could not tell me when/if the Acer would be in stock again. The NEXT day, I read that the Acer would NOT be restocked by Amazon. So I didn't wait and bought it from the Marketplace for $460. Grr.... BUT!!! I am TOALLY PLEASED and happy that I got it when I did. Please note that this Acer IS back on Amazon and you can buy it for less. What a deal.The advice of many reviewers was perfect for my set up. I actually took notes and in the end, set up was incredibly simple and pain-free, and performance has been fantastic. I literally have NO complaints.Based on reviews, I purchased an extra 4G memory stick. ($20) Know what? I still haven't installed it!! I keep forgetting. AND IT HASN'T MADE A DIFFERENCE. To that end, based on reviews, I decided that I would purchase additonal hard drive, but I haven't gotten around to that. Honestly, I may not purchase it at all because I have an external hard drive and I have cloud space. I'm content with knowing that I have the option if I want to purchase more hard drive space if I want. So I have NOT yet had the experience of removing the back of the laptop to install more memory or hard drive. There are plenty of youtube vids that will guide you through the process should you need to do this and I will install the additional memory. Maybe after writing this.Almost no one wants ""S"" mode. There are a few protocols for switching out of ""S"" mode. Here's what I did: I plugged the laptop in, and it began set up. VERY QUICK SET UP. It will automatically be in ""S"" mode: 1. open settings 2. go to ""update & security"" 3. In the ""switch to"" win home or win pro section, select ""go to store."" If you see ""update your edition of windows"" section, do NOT click the ""go to store"" that appears there. 4. Once in the store, you should see a ""switch out of S mode"" or some kind of similar message. Select ""get"". You should get a confirmation message that you've been switched out. SIMPLE and QUICK procedure. I read that some people had trouble with this, but it was a snap for me.List of what I did in total:1. Took out of box, plugged it in. Set up began.2. Got out of ""S"" mode.3. Got rid of a lot of bloatware.4. Downloaded Google Chrome.5. Downloaded Avast Premium Security6. Downloaded Office 3657. Downloaded iTunesEven with all of that, this computer is FAST and as mentioned, I still haven't added additional memory.Powering up/down takes seconds. SECONDS.Navigation is super fast.The computer itself feels solid and I haven't experienced anything with the touchpad that feels chincy or flimsy, as some reviewers noted. . I know what some reviews mean by the bottom corners of the touch pad feeling 'loose'. What it is, is that there are no 'buttons' on the touchpad for ""left or right mouse"" and the lower corners are a tad ""floaty"", as they need to be able to depress independently. I don't use the touchpad a lot, I prefer a desktop mouse, so this doesn't matter to me.The keyboard backlight is great and I've checked with Acer and there's no way to extend the length of time it stays on. It stays on for about 30 secs. This is not an issue for me, as it's on long enough for me to orient myself on the keyboard if it's dark, and then I'm good to go. When typing steadily, the keyboard stays on steadily. Note: one of my cats walked across the keyboard and 'turned off' the backlight. I found that by hitting ""FN + F8"" and holding for 10 secs, you can turn the backlight back on.I LOVE the keyboard. The keyboard feels both solid and smooth. I'm a typist so the ""feel"" of a keyboard and typing is very important to me. My fingers fly over this keyboard! The letters appearing as I type appear to be flowing as words form.The little numeric pad to the right is great. Yes, the keys are a little smaller, so larger fingers may not care for this, but it's great when doing a lot of numeric work. I also love that the ""backspace"" button is larger- not like some keyboards I've had when it's the same size as a letter key.Odd that there's no light showing ""Caps Lock On""- other reviewers have noted this. Nor is there a ""Num Lock"" light, but that doesn't really interfere with my work. It just takes a moment to figure out what's going on if I accidentally leave the Caps Lock on.The power button isn't a hard press button like I've been used to. It's a ""key"", which is interesting.The sound is a big topic on reviews. I've found the sound to be a little low on volume, but it's been ok for youtube vids. Plus, I like using headphones, which make this a non-issue. I've examined the sound settings and done what reviewers have suggested to augment the sound. One reviewer spoke of switching from ""music"" to ""gaming"" mode to increase overall volume, but I haven't even found the setting to do that. No matter, I'm ok with the way it is.The picture/screen is fantastic. Clear and sharp!USB ports-- there are enough for me. I will be purchasing a dvd reader/writer, as this laptop does not have that feature, which makes it lighter and slimmer. In researching dvd drives, I've found highly reviewed ones for around $20. Very reasonable.I have NOT tested battery life yet. I generally keep the laptop in one spot and keep it plugged in. Also, the battery in my SONY Vaio died 2 yrs into owning it and I never replaced it so I'm not even used to moving my laptop around and using a battery. The one time I DID bring this laptop into another room, the battery lasted at least the four hours I had the laptop open.All in all, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this laptop. I've loaded it up and used it CONSTANTLY for two months, haven't installed extra memory yet, and it hasn't given me ONE SECOND of regret or ""hmm"" or concern. It looks great, it's fast, it's light weight, and it can be built up to serve your computer needs. Do NOT worry about ""S"" mode, that's an easy thing to let go of. I have no doubt this laptop will last me years and will serve my needs admirably. If anything else comes up as I continue to use it, I'll be sure to update my review! Despite paying more than what Amazon is currently selling it for, it was STILL a deal. I literally have no complaints at all. I recommend registering it and keeping note of Acer's toll free number in case you need support.Good luck and enjoy! It's a great purchase!UPDATE: It's nearly one year since I've been using this Acer laptop and I STILL love it. It has not given me one second of issue or regret. I ended up installing my additional memory after I posted my review but I haven't purchased additional hard drive. I've loaded a LOT more software and apps and it's still fast, crisp and spot on.

R167GAZ2Y7OPCT,Crystal,"First, I would like to say to ignore the negative reviews from the people who are saying that you can not switch this laptop out of Windows 10 S Mode. You can indeed switch this laptop out of Windows 10 S Mode IF you follow the correct instructions on the website. It will bring you to a page in the Microsoft Store where it will say to get Windows 10 Home. It will NOT ask you to purchase Windows 10 Home.Now that that is out of the way, on to the review of this laptop. After fighting with a Chromebook with Microsoft Office I decided that I needed a cheap windows laptop that way I would be able to type on the actual desktop version of Word.This first thing I would like to mention is the amazing screen quality for the cost of this computer. When you are watching Hulu, YouTube, Netflix, or any other streaming services the screen is clear and the picture is beautiful.The ability to have a backlit keyboard on a budget laptop is an excellent edition and is extremely helpful for using the laptop in a darkly lit room. The keyboard is also fairly nice to type on. I am someone who does a lot of typing and I have no issues at all with the keyboard.The variety of ports, especially nowadays, is an nice touch. Try going dongle free with a high end computer such as a MacBook. This laptop comes with two USB 2.0 ports, one USB 3.0 port, an HDMI port, an Ethernet port, and a headphone jack. I will say that if you do need USB C or you need an SD card reader then you would need a dongle for that but if you are like me and use neither then you are good to go dongle free.The ability to upgrade both the RAM and the storage is an excellent edition. I would highly recommend bumping up the RAM to at least 8GBs as this would allow the computer to run just a little more smoothly. An extra 4GBs of RAM is not expensive (only around $20).This laptop doesn't have a touch screen so if you need a touch screen you may need to look at other options, though I personally think a touch screen in a laptop is pointless.I can say that, though you won't be running high end AAA games at a high resolution or high graphics, you can get certain games to run quite well on the laptop. I can run Sims 4 at the highest graphics settings without any issues and this computer is great as a secondary laptop if you do have a primary desktop PC for gaming. Steam streaming works well with it.The only downside that I have found with this laptop is the battery life, which can get fairly poor depending on what you are doing. This doesn't really affect me too much as I am usually near a power outlet when I need it.I can't really tell you too much about how it would do with photo editing or with video editing as I don't really do that sort of thing but if you need a computer for school work, web browsing, writing, media consumption then this computer is really all that you need.","Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2020",All you need in a computer,5,,27,R3 3200U,15.6-inch
R2FPAEZHX4O6MI,Audrie,"This is my first laptop, so keep in mind that I know nothing about laptops.However, I got this laptop for animation purposes. A creative whim to see if OpenToonz is as great as two hundred Youtubers swear it is.I was worried that it might not be able to handle such complex programs, since it is in fact a budget laptop, but I was pleasantly surprised. Not only does it effectively run OpenToonz, it also handles rendering in Blender and other programs that I thought might be too much for its processing capacity. I've played a few high resolution games on it without any issues, as well.I saw another review from a wonderful human being who knows a lot more about computers than me, and he left in depth instructions on how to turn off S Mode as well as how to upgrade your computer with a couple additional parts to expand its memory and processing. I did not utilize any of those recommendations (yet) and the laptop works amazing!It's got super fast internet, downloads everything quickly, amazing resolution, and like I said, it can handle some pretty tough programs. Some of my friends can't run blender on their own laptops, so that speaks for itself.Still, there are two issues I've found so far.Issue 1, the most obvious:The volume on this laptop is crap. It can be sitting right in front of your face and not be loud enough for you to hear the quieter sounds in a video. This is easy to fix with a speaker, so it's not a big deal, but I'd recommend getting a speaker at the same time you get the laptop just to avoid the disappointment when movie time comes around.Issue 2:It overheats very very VERY easily. Don't set this laptop on any blankets or pillows, or anything other than a hard surface.I noticed quickly that it gets warm basically as soon as you set it down on your lap, so I've been pretty careful about that. But just earlier today, I fell asleep with it on my lap (oops) and when I woke up about an hour later, it was off. It would not turn on. The charging light was blue, meaning that it was charging properly from the cord. When I pressed the power button, however, the power light flashed blue one time very briefly but the laptop didn't even try to turn on. No fans, no clicks, nothing. I waited an hour and tried again, but it still wouldn't turn on. Needless to say, I was horrified!If this happens to you, please don't panic, it's very easy to fix.Windows laptops have this handy dandy feature where they shut themselves off if they're at risk of overheating, to prevent any damage from happening. They also prevent themselves from being turned back on, apparently, but you can fix it in three easy steps.1: Unplug your computer from the power cord.2: Flip the computer over, and use a needle to press and hold the battery reset button located on the bottom for 5 seconds.3: Wait ten full minutes, plug in your computer, and turn it on.Mine booted up instantly when I did that, and I was deeply grateful for the feature that saved my laptop from my own relentless stupidity.With that said, this is a fantastic laptop and it works great, but there are two purchases you should make right off the bat: buy a speaker/headphones, and buy a cooling pad. I also highly recommend buying a mouse; the track pad isn't bad or anything- mine works as well as any track pad I've ever used- but computers are always better with a mouse ;DIf you're considering this laptop, I'd say go for it. Just make sure that if you're buying it for a kid or anyone who has a habit of laying in bed with the laptop in their lap, you get them a cooling pad. Windows will probably prevent it from being damaged from overheating, but you can spare them the panic of a laptop that won't turn on and the struggle of finding a needle that fits the reset hole.Happy browsing, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2021",Bang for your Buck... but two minor issues,5,,63,R3 3200U,15.6-inch
R1FLOKXBFB2SIS,C. L. Messina,"I needed a laptop for simple, low-processor requirement tasks (i.e. I didn't need a gaming laptop), but by the same token, I know how the PC buying experience goes: you want as much processing power and speed as you can get, otherwise you'll just find yourself upgrading everything down the road.Admittedly, 4GB of ram wasn't ideal, but upon comparing this laptop with HP, Lenovo, Dell and others across every possible vendor (including Ebay), I am convinced the processing speed and features are an incredible deal for the money ($365 USD = Acer Aspire 5 w/ 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD hard drive). Other people suggested buying some additional RAM, and being spoiled w/ 32GB of it on my desktop, I definitely agreed, so I ordered an additional 4GB more (A-Tech 4GB RAM for Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop A515-43 | DDR4 2666MHz SODIMM PC4-21300 260-Pin CL19 1.2V Non-ECC Unbuffered Memory Upgrade Module) for $40 USD.I also believe more storage is essential. The Acer Aspire 5 comes with a slot for an additional SSD drive to supplement the 128GB drive, but here's where you have to carefully consider your options. You must look at sequential read and write speeds, where faster is always better. You also have to consider that you will likely have your operating system on the main (C:) drive.If I were to use the supplemental SSD slot, I would have to go with a SATA III type storage (looks like a very small, thin book). If I want much better speed for the price, I'll want to replace the 128GB ""C:"" drive with the same type (PCIe Gen3 8 Gb/s, looks more like a RAM stick). I went with the 1TB Crucial P5 (1TB 3D NAND NVMe Internal SSD, up to 3400MB/s - CT1000P5SSD8) for $120 USD. It's a pain to switch it out, because you have to make an 'image' (i.e. copy) of your C drive on some other storage device, then put that image onto the new SSD drive, but in the long run, it's worth it because you're coming out of the gate with much more storage and very likely (couldn't find specs on the Aspire hard drive) a much faster hard drive.So, $525 ( = $365 + $40 + $120) and you get:CPU 3.52 GHz8GB RAM1TB hard drive with up to 3400MB/s read speed and up to 3000MB/s write speed15 inch monitorunder 4lb SLIM laptopANDWindows 10.I call that an incredible deal.Now, I've read the comments about Windows 10 S. The myth is that you get locked into a system where you can only buy and install Microsoft software unless you want to shell out... man, what was it? Oh yeah, a trillion dollars. Well, turns out that's:FALSE!In fact, all you have to do is sign into your free Microsoft account, push a button and 'boom', you're off of Windows 10S and on Windows 10. No charge, no hassle, no anything. In fact, the laptop asks if you want to do this on setup, but either way, the instructions are easy to find with a Google search. Whoever wrote these other reviews apparently aren't familiar with Google searches. I can only wish them luck on their new journey to 'the internet' and beyond. I have no idea how they were able to buy this laptop or write a review.Regardless...It's true that you don't get Windows 10 Pro and have to shell out a few bucks for it ($99 at the time I'm posting, 10 March 2021), but most people don't need it unless they want to use MS OneDrive cloud storage (monthly subscription) or remote desktop. I use Google cloud (free) for some things and never log onto my laptop from another computer (i.e. remote desktop): I just take the laptop with me when I need it. Either way, Windows 10 comes free with this machine, you just have to switch it at the MS store, and that takes less than a minute.All that said, this laptop is just awesome. I love the weight, size, backlit keys and speed. Could not be happier.","Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2021",Perhaps you need a tin can,5,,23,R3 3200U,15.6-inch
RVIKFNTNS9RAD,Austin,"Okay, so full disclosure. I'm a computer repair technician and I bought the base model (Ryzen 3 w/4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD). As a technician (meaning someone who can upgrade and repair computers), I'd give this a 3.5/5. As an end user however, I really don't know who this is supposed to be made for. It's woefully underpowered and comes with a crippled OS. If you don't mind those things then there are a lot of cheaper options. If you DO mind those things then I hope you know what you're doing because it's going to take a LOT of time and effort to get this thing usable.First off, S mode. It's basically a Chromebook in S mode. Again, you can get a Chromebook (or even another S mode device) for much cheaper than this so I don't know why you'd choose this one. Putting that aside however, most people say that you can just get out of S mode and you'll have a normal computer, right? Well, in THEORY that's true. In practice however, Windows 10S likes to randomly and inexplicably revert to S mode without warning. As a technician I see these S mode computers all the time that have reverted back to S mode with no way to go back to Windows 10 Home except to do a complete wipe and reload of the OS. If you want to PERMANENTLY get out of S Mode, you have to get out of S mode, then download a copy of Windows 10 from the Microsoft website and make a USB flash drive with Windows 10. Then you have to open up the flash drive, go into the Sources folder and add an ei.cfg file with the following parameters:[EditionID]Home[Channel]RetailOnce you do that you can boot from the flash drive, erase the drive, and install Windows 10 Home from scratch. If you don't add the ei.cfg file it will just reinstall Windows 10S again. This is not something a normal end user would be able to do, but it's necessary if you want to be able to feel secure that the thing isn't going to just randomly revert back to S mode and become unusable.Secondly, the specs. 4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD? Seriously, Acer? The last time 4GB of RAM was standard on laptops was like 2012. I could see if this were a $150 computer, but at $366 it should have at LEAST 8GB of RAM and a 250GB SSD. I upgraded mine to 8GB of RAM, a 500GB NVMe SSD, and a 2TB 2.5"" hard drive. It's been close to a decade since I've personally owned a computer with a hard drive but it's nice to have that ability. I also appreciate the fact that they include the mounting hardware and even the screws in a separate bag.Third, the screen. The screen is okay, but there's a major flaw that took me a while to figure out. The screen will dim if you unplug the charger and run it on battery. That's normal, right? Well what's NOT normal is that AMD has a setting called ""Vari-Bright."" If this is turned on and you unplug the computer, the display doesn't just dim but it also loses contrast/color. It's hard to describe it but it looks like crap. Unfortunately the AMD Radeon software doesn't get installed through Windows Update and it's not on Acer's website so you have to go directly to AMD in order to download it. Unfortunately that also means that AMD is going to install the latest drivers on your device, which haven't been tested and certified compatible by Acer. Chances are it will be fine, but it's always best to use the latest driver from the computer manufacturer (in this case, Acer) rather than going to the chip manufacturer. There are a million and one potential compatibility problems with new drivers, which is why they need to be tested by the manufacturer, who may update other drivers to compensate. This isn't possible if you want to turn off ""Vari-Bright"" because you're forced to install the latest drivers from AMD.The next problem is with the keyboard backlight. It turns off after 30 seconds and it won't turn back on again if you move the mouse. You MUST touch a key on the keyboard to turn it on again. There's a setting in the BIOS to disable the keyboard backlight timeout, but it doesn't have any effect. Speaking of which, this computer shipped with an older BIOS revision (1.10). I upgraded to the latest BIOS revision (1.11) but it didn't fix the keyboard backlight timeout problem. Looking online it seems that a LOT of people are having this problem and not only with this model of Acer. Apparently, Acer doesn't care about this problem. I almost want to return it for this reason, but I really need another computer so I guess I'll keep it. If I hadn't been able to resolve the screen brightness problem this would have been going back.The final issue is the battery life. If all you're doing is reading articles this MIGHT be able to get you 4 hours of battery life. If you're watching videos or you have a lot of stuff open, you'll be lucky to get 2-3 hours. I mean, all manufactures overestimate their battery life to make their products look good, but this laptop doesn't last much longer than my 10 year old HP.In conclusion, I stand by my initial statement. I truly don't know who this computer is for. If you add the cost of the base computer ($366), plus the 500GB SSD ($60), the RAM ($45), and the 2TB hard drive ($80), you're left with a total cost of $551, and there are a lot better computers out there at that price point. There's an 11th gen i5 15"" HP laptop on here for $599 with over TWICE the processing power, a 250GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM. It also has space for a secondary hard drive if you need to upgrade that in the future. If you're okay with an underpowered laptop (4GB RAM, small SSD) with a crippled OS (Windows 10S) you can get one for $150 and save yourself $200.I mean, I wouldn't call this thing a ""nice"" laptop. It only has a single USB 3 port (the other two, including the one on the RIGHT side are USB 2.0 - that's right, a technology that debut in April of 2000 which means it's even older than Windows XP!). It feels cheap/flimsy. Battery life is mediocre. It's basically a disposable laptop at a non-disposable price. If this laptop was $150 - $200 I wouldn't be so critical of it, but whether you're looking for a cheap Chromebook type laptop or you want a real laptop that you can upgrade yourself, you can do so much better by going with something else. I'm only keeping it because I've put so much time and effort into it and it's easier than returning it and starting over.The only person I can see that this would be suited for would be someone with a very limited budget that wants to be able to upgrade it over time vs. spending the $550 upfront. But if they knew how to do all this computer stuff, chances are they'd have a better income and therefore a higher budget. Maybe a student or someone just entering the workforce? I dunno.I must say though, I'm really liking having a secondary drive in a laptop again. It helps if I need to wipe it out because I don't have to worry about backing up the data since it's on the second hard drive. But again, there are other computers with this capability. If you can afford it, the $599 HP with the 11th gen i5 is a great buy. I haven't personally purchased that computer but after doing all this, I wish I had.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2021",I really don't know who this is supposed to be made for,1,,244,R3 3200U,15.6-inch
RV1GR3CG72GL1,Baroque Tossit,"Aspire 5 with 4gb RAM 128gb PCIe NVMe SSD drive notes (long, so you may want to skip this review):Aluminum cover, plastic housing.Left side ports - Ethernet cable, HDMI, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, Headphone jack.Right side ports - Kensington computer lock port, USB 2.0.Notably missing - no port for SD cards at all.Not a touch screen, but nice in color and clarity. (Opinions on screens and keyboards tend to vary widely - what suits me perfectly may seem to be junk to you, so YMMV).The speakers on the front underside - the sound is O.K. (for an inexpensive laptop) but volume is lacking.Power supplied through a proprietary Acer plug, not through a USB-C port. Cord can only attach to the laptop on the left side (as seen by the user at the keyboard).Windows ""S"" is installed; it is limited to running apps available only in the Microsoft Store.Suggested upgrade - move up to Windows 10 Home. It's a free upgrade - with the caveat that you cannot return to ""S"" version.To upgrade to Home version (instructions as of the date of this review; I assume/accept no responsibility if things go awry. You may want to Google instructions to verify):Go to Settings.Then select Update & Security.In the left sidebar, click Activation.Then click “Go to the Store.”Press the “Get” button under the “Switch out of S Mode” section and in a very short time you'll be assigned the Windows Home version.Suggested upgrade - if you want to encrypt your laptop you may want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise. These upgrades are not free, check Microsoft for current pricing.The Aspire 5 has a TPM chip so encryption will not require a boot password (not your Windows password).If you want to set a boot password for the computer (not your Windows password) you can set that in BIOS. Don't forget it - resetting a boot password on a laptop can be a pain and a half (or impossible) to rectify. See below on how to get into BIOS.The included 128GB PCIe NVMe SSD drive is (for me) large enough to hold Windows 10 Enterprise and the applications I use and is quick enough to run them. I'm in I.T. support (although semi-retired) and don't use the Aspire 5 for computer games. YMMV.Suggested upgrade - add an additional SSD to the computer (screws are in the box, housing and cable required are inside the Aspire 5). You can Google videos on how to perform the upgrade. A second internal drive allows you to separate your data from your operating system and applications; if Windows ever has to be completely re-installed your data won't be affected. If you keep your data in the Cloud you can set the second drive as the sync drive and not fill up “C:” drive.The chip, an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U, does pretty well for my purposes. Again, gamers may have a different opinion so YMMV. I've had no issues when viewing training or YouTube videos.The battery life won't get me through a typical support day without at least some recharge time - Acer claims up to 7 1/2 hours but, of course, that depends on what you're doing. Watching videos will eat more power than writing a project proposal in Word. YMMV, but I bought a second power cord to take with me to client offices while leaving the cord at my home office plugged in. I seem to be getting 5 hours, maybe a bit better, with the screen set to maximum brightness.The machine doesn't get overly warm in use (again, I'm not a gamer), but I use a laptop board most of the time when the laptop isn't on a hard surface, so there is nearly always some airflow under the machine.The included 4gb of included RAM is really the absolute minimum to think about with Windows 10.Suggested upgrade - add a single 4gb RAM chip in the empty slot (Google for videos on that) to bring the total to 8gb RAM. After installing the additional 4gb the computer will report 8gb installed with ""5.94gb usable"". The 'missing' RAM is being commandeered by the Radeon software for the display. If you need/want more the machine can support up to 32gb (1 16gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed). 16gb would require 1 8gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed. For business purposes (Office, Chrome and You Tube videos) I'm finding the 8gb (5.94 available) to be acceptable. YMMV.How 'easy' the RAM and hard drive upgrades are depends on how comfortable you are working with computers. I found them quite simple. Be careful not to crack the plastic housing when removing the bottom cover. Using the correct plastic spudge is helpful, you can search Amazon for a selection of tools. (spudge = type of plastic or rubber pry bar). Google the ‘how-to’ videos first.""Bloatware"" included with the computer isn't completely over-the-top, but it does take a few minutes to delete all of the junk. The ""Microsoft Office"" included with the Aspire 5 is a 30-day trial version, not a full license.After uninstalling the bloatware I installed Microsoft Office365 with Access, Adobe Photoshop Elements, DIA (a program for diagramming), AllwaySync (a backup program), Google Chrome, Splashtop Business and Personal (remote access software), VLC Media Player and a couple of network utility applications. I have 78gb of free space left on ""C"" drive.The three small stickers showing Ryzen chip, Aspire 5 inclusions, and Radeon graphic chip that are stuck onto the hand rest part of the computer can be easily peeled off and leave no residue (I was able to rub the remaining adhesive off easily with my thumb). I don't know why the stickers are there - presumably if you've bought the machine you know what the details are without seeing sticky notes on the keyboard surface. If they're for advertising purposes in the store it might be more cost effective to print advertising to be placed by the machine rather than label every machine on the production line. I also found the ""Full 1080 HD"" sticker on the screen bezel easy to take off. So I did. If Acer is interested in putting relevant data on stickers, how about putting the Make, Exact Model Number, Serial Number, and Date of Manufacture on a sticker? THAT one I would leave in place. As it is you need to flip the machine upside down to see the manufacturer's information. (Sorry - this is a pet peeve of mine).A couple of quick notes for those who are new to Windows laptops - if the keyboard fails to light up, check the F8 key - it can toggle the light on/off. If you suddenly lose your WiFi connection check the F2 key - that toggles ""Airplane Mode"" on/off. Note that the ""function"" keys are set to use the little icons (F1 is sleep, F9 is mute, etc.). To use them as traditional function keys you need to hold down the ""Fn"" key simultaneously. Fn+F9, for instance, will cause the Outlook application to re-sync when you've got that desktop app open. If you prefer the traditional function key usage (not having to hold down the Fn key to use the keys within applications) you can toggle that in BIOS. To get into BIOS, reboot the computer and immediately start tapping the F2 key (no Fn key required).For me the 'sweet spot' of laptops is in the 14"" range (11"" for road trips). That being acknowledged I don't find the extra width or weight of the Aspire 5 to be onerous - the thin screen bezel allows the claim to the 15.6"" screen while not unduly expanding the overall size of the laptop. At nearly 4 pounds it's a bit heavier than the under-three-pounds-sweetness that I prefer but it's not too bad. Especially after removing the weight of those ridiculous stickers. YMMV.If you need more power than this machine has, Acer does offer a similar package with upgrades to the Ryzen 5 chip, 8gb of RAM, and 250gb of hard drive space as well as some other goodies:https://www.amazon.com/Acer-A515-44-R41B-Hexa-Core-Processor-Graphics-dp-B087N4ZRXV/dp/B087N4ZRXV/ref=dp_ob_title_ceHTHRegards,Jim","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2020",Better with a couple of upgrades but works OK out of the box,5,,559,R3 3200U,15.6-inch
R3UAXUXMK8QFAE,Cocoa Sunshine,"well i'm using it to write this review. so there's that. lol.bought this in march of 2020. one thing i never understood is when companies want you to write a review immediately after purchasing an item, and you haven't even had the opportunity to really use it, or put it through the paces.so any review you give would be a false one. cause if the item doesn't last was it worth it?so here we are. almost three years later. and yes it does work.one thing that i found rather annoying is that it has nothing on it.we live in this world of apps and more. this wasn't my first computer purchase. so imagine my chagrin when i opened it up to a fully blank screen with zero programs on it.we live in a world where these companies are about giving you less and less for more money. akin to going to the hairstylist, they want to charge you extra for washing your hair, which was an part of the package, AND a requirement in getting your hair done.the same with this. now they want you to pay for the computer PLUS all of the apps separately. and they call it progress. you'd think with that being the case it would be faster. nope.you have to constantly reboot it just to get the web browsers to work properly. as you're using it the screens will change and fade out on you to safe mode. sometimes it freezes and you don't know why.the constant notifications about microsoft updates are a nuisance.does it still work like it did when i bought it? yes it does. but i have to be mindful of programs i attempt to use on it. because i'll get an error message that there isn't enough storage to run the programs on the hard drive. smh.this claimed to have the ability to use multiple applications and do split screens and more. well you can have the apps up at the same time. but good luck passing back and forth between them. i can't use anything from the adobe suite. because there's not enough ram.the few programs i loaded on it all have issues of usage and it tells of space and storage issues. ""slowing it down"" when the apps are open.and that microsoft store is not it. that's the biggest issue of all. you're pretty confined to the usage of ""apps' that they offer UNLESS you download a whole other program that basically works on top of the microsoft. which is a nuisance and yet another reason to not purchase this.if this is the way of life of computer purchases where you have to download a google app just to put programs on a computer that you'll use. when they USED to work well with and for microsoft years ago... just nope. why should we have to deal with these complications.before it was about making a cell phone like a computer. but now they're trying to make computers like cell phones. and this is one place where it just ain't premium and not working.i hate it. the programs i need and use i can't take advantage of. the stuff i don't want or need are here. they're good for pushing microsoft programs on you. but if you're in this world you know that microsoft doesn't excel at all types of needs involving a computer. so be aware when you're buying this if you purchase it.also it's so old now that i would say it's not even worth the money they're charging for it. upgrade yourself and get something that will be worth your money.yes they have chromebooks where work from a google mainframe. but they're no better either. because they don't allow you to add on whole programs that you may need either. it's like you can't seem to win these days when buying a computer.just be aware when you're making a purchase. pay attention to the ram. pay attention to the storage space. the number of usb outlets. those do matter. this has three. and i use them all.oh one other thing. last year in 2022 the cord malfunctioned and stopped working to charge it up. so i had to purchase a replacement. which doesn't even fit well. but it does charge it up. so there's that i just have to be mindful if i'm plugged in and the new plug doesn't drop out.so yes it still works. the battery life, not so good roughly a good 2-3 hours of usage out of it, even this many years after the fact. but then i rarely use it without the plug, because i've found that most laptops don't work as well without a plug. and all claim to have a long battery life, until you put them to the test.not being plugged in you don't get full usage of the applications as you'd like. everything slows down. something i don't like. even the web browsers tend to struggle more when it's not plugged in.the sound from the speakers is midrange. not great but not poor. there are things i'd prefer to be louder. but you deal. it's not a touchscreen. but i didn't need it to be one.i paid $343 for this back in 2020. that it's now a few dollars more if it were purchased new today, AND IT'S OLD AND OUTDATED says much to me. this thing needs to be way cheaper given what you get and don't get. it's basically two steps from being obsolete.screen resolution is okay. and to be honest. i bought an acer. cause i've purchased from the name brands that charge more and received a mediocre product. so i figured if i were to get something that was not premium, i didn't want to pay a premium price for it.in the end people are going to spend their money how they choose. so if you want it do it. get it. but i wouldn't.","Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2023",it is what it is.,4,,191,R3 3200U,15.6-inch

R3G4O65AZ1MVV9,Fae,"At first I was so excited to receive this laptop due to the massive amount of amazing reviews, however upon receiving this laptop I had already noticed some not great things.If you like big laptops this is definitely the one for you! I’m personally not a big fan of the size, it also wasn’t very slim. It was extremely difficult to fit in my laptop bag even though the bag was made for a 20 inch laptop such as this one. It’s very bulky in my opinion. When I turned it on it was already having issues. The noise from the fans is INSANE!!! If you want a quiet laptop for school I do not recommend this at all. It was super noisy. The other issue I had is that the computer was CONSTANTLY using half of the ram and due to the computer having 8gb of ram, that only left 4gb for anything else you need to do. Opening up browsers or really anything was super slow. It wasn’t easy to use at all. I ended up factory resetting it twice and it helped a little bit but not much. Pretty much the only thing that was good about this laptop was the keyboard. It was pretty nice and had a quiet sound. The laptops condition wasn’t great when I got it either. It had scratches in some areas. I ended up buying a refurbished dell laptop and it worked so much better.If you want to try this out for yourself go ahead, but I personally did not enjoy a second of the headache this laptop caused me. Returning wasn’t easy either and I found out this store is a third party store so the only way to return it is to print out the shipping label and wait for UPS to come by your house. You aren’t really given a time they will be there either and they definitely aren’t willing to work with you on it. So be prepared to stay home all day.On a good note it did come early!Edit: Forgot to mention, the computer comes on something called “S Mode” it basically blocks anything and everything that isn’t Microsoft based.

I settled on this one after looking at reviews and once I got it started up I quickly realized that in order to download whatever apps you wanted onto it that were not Microsoft apps, you have to switch the computer out of S mode. I’m not a super techy person and I didn’t even know what S mode was, but I quickly googled it and realized that it is a freaking pain in the butt To switch out of. Microsoft makes it next to impossible to do this. After searching several online forums and trying multiple things that people suggested I finally was able to switch out of this mode and have the ability to download whatever apps I want. For example, the cricut app and chrome browser app cannot be downloaded while in s mode. All the time I spent trying to get out of S mode took probably three total hours. In my opinion this is an insanely stupid feature and had I known this computer came ith S mode or even what it was For that matter, I probably would’ve gone with a different one.

R2RNB5DFUYWONH,S. Taylor,"This laptop was at the top of my list as far as cost and processing speed, but there seem to be a lot more things to be irritated about than excited about.1. No CD-ROM/DVD-ROM. I have no idea how I missed this. I went to install my printer software and realized there is no drive to do this. I thought it was so common-place that I never even considered a laptop being sold without one. How very bizarre. This means no DVD burning capabilities, no installing a game disc, nothing. Wow. Now maybe I'm old-fashioned since many things are done digitally now, but geez. My bad on not paying attention to the product description. I always back up my photography to disc, ALWAYS. nope, can't with this laptop. Fixed by spending $50 more to buy a used external drive.2. Why do modern laptops use one single mousepad for right-click, left-click, and moving the cursor? I can't tell you how frustrating that was. I can only use this laptop with an outside USB mouse, otherwise, I would be pulling my hair out every time I touch the thing. I attempted to adjust the sensitivity but with no way of feeling a right or left click, you end up clicking somewhere in the middle half the time.3. The sound on this thing is terrible. I had to buy a USB speaker so I can even hear some stuff. Speakers on the bottom of the laptop, wow. You can cup the sound to try to hear what you are listening to. What a joke. Speakers I bought were also crap so spent at least $40 trying to get audible sound for this laptop.I would rather a laptop be slightly bulkier for better features. I feel that I downgraded from my previous laptop that is at least 5 years older. My last laptop had a larger screen, a mousepad that had separate buttons for right and left click, sound I could hear, AND a DVD-ROM. Wow.Why I gave it two stars? The processing speed is ok. Still, it is no better or worse than any other new computer or laptop I have ever bought, it is just less bogged down with junk when it is new. I almost thought about returning it numerous times, but it sucks to have to delete everything and start fresh again on a new system. I also think there is a restocking fee since it isn't technically broken. Too bad because I would pay more for a system that was more functional. Since I bought the speaker and have the mouse, at least I fixed two of the issues on my own.Hell no to playing video games. I tried playing Cloudpunk on Steam and it lagged so bad I gave up. Sure, you can play games, just not higher quality ones.Lastly because I just can't stop. Why does my backspace key make a weird high-pitched sound? Weird. I do NOT recommend this product and would not buy it again.Edit: Now my ""L"" key isn't functioning properly and I have to hit it harder or twice to get it to work. This is by far the cheapest laptop I have ever owned, and I'm very disappointed with it. Saving money did NOT work out this time. I am still a student so use my laptop quite frequently. This will surely agitate and slow me down and now I'm wishing I had paid more for a better laptop. It hasn't even been a year of ownership.. BUYER BEWARE!Second edit: less than two years after purchase.. I didn’t expect to need to update this again, but now my battery is dead and it barely held a charge for most of its life. I knocked it down to one star. I have an older laptop that still holds charge and the battery still works. The quality of this product is very poor. Still one of my biggest regrets since laptops are extremely useful for school and I’m not finished yet. Do I buy a new battery and suck it up? This laptop will cost $500+ by the time I’m done buying new parts, and still will have issues. I sure wish companies would build quality products made to last… made to last at least 5 years.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2020",Well that was a disappointment,1,,37,R3 3200U,15.6-inch
R3HIWSCOK91D22,Beth Rollins,"I would not recommend buying this. I purchased in March 2020 to prepare for working remotely. Everything was fine- it all worked as it should. Now the built-in camera has stopped functioning properly. It looks like it is working but there is only a black screen in the image window- for both camera and video. On zoom calls, it looks like the video is working but there is nothing but a black screen. Open up the camera using the camera app- same thing. Updating driver shows that the current driver is installed. Resetting the app does nothing. Resetting privacy settings does nothing. Troubleshooting does nothing- all diagnostics indicate that everything is ""working properly"", no issues. One day it worked fine. The next day it did not. Searches on both the Acer community forum on their website and google in general show multiple users all reporting the same exact problem- and following all of the same steps, with absolutely no resolution. Chatting with Acer technical support- the best they can offer is ""try a factory reset"" and if that doesn't work, send it in for repair. Which of course is impossible because the laptop is now my office for work since my company is still working remotely for the foreseeable future. So in order to send this one in to be repaired, I would need to buy a new one anyway in order to keep my job. I've had multiple laptops over the years- HP, Asus, samsung- all worked for years. This is the first (and hopefully only time) that I've had one stop functioning in less than 4 months after purchase- with no viable resolution offered by the company.**EDIT- Factory Reset fixed nothing and just made re-setting up everything that was removed a pain in the butt. Camera is still non-functional. Acer tech support and customer support useless. No solution offered other than sending the laptop that I rely on every day in for repair- despite the fact that you can easily google and find the same issue reported by multiple users going back to at least 2018. Support rep that I spoke to the second time claimed that on their system, they don't show that there are any reported issues with the Aspire 5. SMH. Worst customer service ever. And I'll never purchase Acer again.If I could make the rating no stars, I would . Not only did the build-in camera stop working with no apparent solution, a plug & play webcam won't work either. Uninstall the built-in webcam and it aumotically reinstalls itself. The P&P webcam works fine on a $200 5 yr old laptop that my 8 yr old has tortured- but won't work on this 9 month old laptop. Whatever is causing the problem with the built-in camera (that Acer claims isn't a recognized or persistent problem on its machines despite pages of forum posts ) prevents any other camera from working as well.Edit #2- finally gave up in the constant fiddling necessary to use this laptop. Plug & play camera I bought when the built in camera stopped functioning only works part of the time because the laptop won't recognize its plugged in. Wifi drops without any cause (only happens on the laptop). Speaker quality has degraded to the point where I have to use headphones or a speaker to hear anything. External areas of the laptop are coming apart. Two weeks ago it wouldn't boot up- then it did and seemed fine. A few days later, opening anything took forever- browser windows, internal functions, couldn't get the shutdown menu to pop up. Happened again two days ago. I gave up and drove to best buy to buy a lenovo. Within 15 minutes of turning on the new laptop, I realized just how terrible the Acer has overall functioned from day one. I don't need high-end functionality- not a gamer, not a graphic designer, not running a business. I've had a number of computers from desktop to laptop that have lasted for years.

R3EUG37YPXZTPL,James Marshall,"By itself, this is an excellent device. However, due to terrible support and shady practices, it's been wildly cheapened by Acer.1. Acer installed their own adware on my device without my knowledge or consent. Worse, they created unchangeable notification settings, buried the installation files in a hidden directory, abused the character limit to hide it from the program removal tool; either hid it from the registry with deceptive location and naming, or used a scheduled executable and won't provide the information necessary to determine whether simply deleting the files is safe.2. People who have deleted the files are reporting either a failure to completely remove [meaning the files bounced back] or breaks caused by the removal of the files. These breaks include loss of data, boot looping, massive decrease in system performance, and registry errors.3. Acer has provided no tool for removing their bloatware. One must blindly trust a third party tool for the ""safe"" removal of the software.4. The tech support doesn't know how to remove the software, instead redirecting me to other resources that either don't address this specific issue directly or don't provide a solution. Windows cannot detect and remove software that has a name longer than 60 characters in the registry. The removal must be performed through the registry. Because the identify of these files in the registry is not published, it would take hours - days to find and remove the software via the registry. This method could result in the aforementioned breaks, especially if done incorrectly. For example, an accidental removal of a vital system file could occur.5. After waiting well over half an hour in their support queue, being as how I got in before they closed for business, the support team left for the day while I was STILL waiting for support. The chat support agent doesn't open after hours. I have a screenshot of the agent being open, meaning I made it in time for support. They simply didn't care and left anyway.I bought this machine for work and have to deal with interruptions because of this adware. I haven't owned this device for even two whole months yet. This wasn't an issue until this week, when the adware went active. During some automatic system update, this was enabled. After the last automatic system update from last month (March 25, 2020), I took advantage of my Windows Pro privileges, looked up the proper way to disable automatic system updates, and then promptly did so [this cannot be done through normal Windows system settings without setting up a metered connection, which I'm unable to do because I telecommute for work and it would interfere with the systems in place with my employer].The hardware is EXCELLENT for the price, however, the experience with Acer is a NIGHTMARE. I won't suggest missing this device. Buy it, buy and install Windows 10 Pro, find out how to turn off automatic system updates via the Group Policy Editor, disable automatic updates there and in system settings [to be safe] AS SOON AS it this laptop boots for the first time, buy and install your [secondary] 2.5 inch SSD / HDD / hybrid drive, and buy and install your RAM upgrades [up to 32 GB supported]. If you do that, you'll have a wonderful experience with this device. If you make the mistake of trusting Acer not to compromise your system through updates after you purchase, you'll have a pretty bad experience trying to fix what they sneakily do to it. Once you're loaded with dozens of GB of data, it's not nearly so easy to just start over.This rating is justified by this company policy. The company did this to my laptop.

From the moment I unboxed the device, I encountered significant issues that rendered the laptop unusable.The primary issue was that the laptop failed to load properly right from the start. Upon booting up, it would either freeze on the startup screen or get stuck in an endless loop of restarts. This made it impossible to access the operating system or complete any setup process.Another major problem was the keyboard, which simply did not work. No keystrokes were registered, making it impossible to type anything or navigate through any initial setup screens that did manage to appear. This is a fundamental flaw, as a functional keyboard is essential for any laptop.While the build quality seemed decent upon initial inspection, the severe functional issues overshadowed any potential positives in this area. A laptop that doesn't load or register keystrokes is essentially a non-functional piece of equipment, regardless of how sturdy or sleek it looks.I immediately contacted customer support to address these issues. The support team was unresponsive and discourteous, they were unable to provide a solution that resolved the problems. As a result, I had no choice but to return the laptop.The Acer Aspire 3 laptop failed to meet even the most basic expectations. With severe loading issues and a non-functional keyboard, it was clear that this device was not ready for use.If you're in the market for a reliable and functional laptop, I would advise looking elsewhere.

I should have done more diligence, and read more reviews on YouTube and other sites before buying this particular model laptop (the A 315 24P in the 7320U configuration). It's slow, sometimes freezes up with basic programs, and you can't upgrade RAM, which really hurts. Very misleading descriptions and advertising for this product. There are several similar model options, be very careful when comparing.Pros: Cheap, which is the big selling point here. Easy initial setup, boots quickly, lightweight, display quality is not horrible, decent battery life.Cons: It's slow...like really slow. I get stuck waiting to click on internet links, navigating back and forth between pages, and when using software programs...waiting for the computer to respond, and occasionally having to reboot. This is with plenty of space on the hard drive, also. The fact that you can't upgrade the RAM is really frustrating,the 8gb dual chips are soldered on, no way to change or upgrade.There is no backlit keyboardor touchscreen toggling, despite what the Amazon descriptions might lead you to believe. Sound quality from the onboard (tiny) speakers is horrible, even with my very low expectations for that. Super ""tinny"" and low volume.Overall, very disappointed.

R30U153MVWDKSV,Non Stop Horizon,"This is considered a budget computer, but for us computer geeks, this is the base for several ""premium"" models. I can't really write a review of the computer out of the box because before I ever turned it on, I installed a 2nd RAM card, then when I booted it, I signed into my account which changed it from Windows 10 S mode to Windows 10 Pro since I have several Windows 10 Pro product keys associated with my account.With that being said, this computer outperforms what it is meant to do. Is this going to be the strongest computer you can buy? No, not at all. However, this computer has edited large videos for me in minutes, I can use my music notation software on it with no lag or freezing (Sibelius), and it does actually process games at the higher resolutions. I've tested games as demanding as Forza Horizon 4 and it, surprisingly, performs with no issues. It does run hotter, of course, but not exactly ""hot"". Heavier usage draws down the battery, but that can be said for literally any electronic device.I purchased this to replace my well-aged HP G60 whatever model that was that I purchased 12 years ago and just kept updating. Up until around July 2020, it was still up to specs to work from home, something I actually bought that computer for 12 years ago. Finally, an update to most of the work at home platforms finally rendered that old beast useless. Ironically, I used the stimulus check from back then (2008) to purchase that computer. With that laptop in mind, I premium laptop to me is one that I can upgrade and repair easily. The HP G60 line did that quite well. Now here in 2020, I purchased one of these for someone else at first. During setup, I noticed the slot to add another SSD, I added the second RAM chip for that one as well since I already knew about that, but I also noticed how easy it was to work on it. We booted it up, put a Windows 10 Pro key on it as well, and from the start, I was impressed with the performance. I was so impressed that I bought myself one.This thing is super lightweight. The keyboard does have slight smaller keys which takes all of about 20 seconds to get used to. This is because it fit a full number pad on the right of the main keyboard, something that is a must for me with a laptop. One thing I absolutely don't find at this price range is the backlit keyboard.Spoiler alert: with the backlight turned on for the keyboard, your battery time can be reduced by as much as 50%. You really don't need it if you're used to typing on pretty much any keyboard, but it's nice when you do need it at night in the middle of a shift. The button to turn it on and off is located pretty much at the center of the top row (F keys). Just to the left of that is the button to turn off the track pad. Very nice placement on both of those.The graphics seems to use a combination of resources that gives you 5 GB reserved just for graphics processing. Not bad at all. This must be what pushes it to be able to do a lot more than expected for this price.It's nice going into the Microsoft Store to check the system requirements on games (Halo series, Forza Horizon, etc) and not see any red indicating the computer doesn't meet the requirements.For working from home, this is excellent for those resources that might require a proprietary desktop that you have to load and run via USB. It also has a built in ethernet port, which is usually required for those particular work from home platforms, but it also performs flawlessly on the 5 GHz wifi networks for the rest.As a digital nomad, I also have to upload and edit and create videos. This thing surprisingly gets through Adobe and other applications with ease and renders videos quite fast.This was supposed to be a quick purchase for me to replace my aged out HP and then I'd get another good laptop later on, but I'm probably just going to buy a couple more of these.*Update*I've noticed two things that improved performance. First, I downloaded the full AMD Radeon Software (it comes with the ""lite"" version) and that opened up a lot of performance tweaks on both the cpu and gpu.Also, I'm noticing the battery time listed must be an overall average. When I'm just browsing, watching a few Youtube videos in the browser, and doing stuff like writing product reviews, with the brightness turned down to the lowest setting and with the backlit keyboard off, I seem to get between 9 and 10 hours of battery life from a full charge. Not sure if that's normal for this device, but it's what I keep noticing. Make sure you also turn off bluetooth and location and all that other stuff you're likely not using because those can draw the battery down quickly. When I have the brightness up, keyboard lights on, playing games with the Xbox controller connected via bluetooth, working (headset in, running work platform software), the battery time can be as low as 5 hours from a full charge.I don't allow any sleep or hibernate functions. Those tend to kill a hard drive. There's nothing I'm ever doing that can't just be saved so I can properly shut the computer down. Sleep and hibernate modes can also do some strange things to batteries, usually causing software glitches that can wreck even the best batteries. They can also cause data fragmentation... all in all, I just don't use those functions on any computer, and for all I know, it could contribute to the better luck I have with laptop batteries and having never had hard drive failure.","Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2020","Easily 5 stars for the range of laptops it's supposed to be in. * Update, still 5 stars. *",5,,128,R3 3200U,15.6-inch
